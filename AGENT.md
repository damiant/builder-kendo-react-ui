# Design System Component Reference

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the design system's component architecture and available components for code generation and development reference.

## System Architecture

The design system follows a modular component-based architecture where each component group provides specific functionality. Components are organized into logical groups that can work independently or in combination with other components.

### Component Organization Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Each component group serves a specific purpose
- **Composability**: Components can be combined to create complex interfaces
- **Consistency**: All components follow the same design patterns and API conventions
- **Accessibility**: Components are built with accessibility standards in mind

## Documentation Structure

For detailed documentation on any component group, refer to the corresponding MDX file in the `design-system-docs` folder. The documentation files follow the naming convention:

```
design-system-docs/[componentgroupname].mdx
```

For example:
- `design-system-docs/button.mdx` - Detailed documentation for Button component
- `design-system-docs/grid.mdx` - Detailed documentation for Grid component
- `design-system-docs/dialog.mdx` - Detailed documentation for Dialog component
- `design-system-docs/toolbar.mdx` - Detailed documentation for Toolbar component

These MDX files contain comprehensive information including:
- Component API documentation
- Usage examples
- Props and configuration options
- Best practices and implementation guidelines
- Accessibility requirements
- Integration patterns with other components

## Usage Guidelines

### Component Dependencies
- Most components are self-contained and can be used independently
- Component groups like Grid, Toolbar, Dialog, and others require multiple sub-components to work together
- Some components work better in combination (e.g., Input with InputPrefix/InputSeparator, Badge with BadgeContainer)

### Integration Patterns
- Layout components (GridLayout, StackLayout, TileLayout) typically serve as containers for other components
- Form controls should be wrapped in Label or FloatingLabel components for proper labeling
- Navigation components (AppBar, BottomNavigation, Menu) can be used independently or as part of larger layout structures
- Data display components (Grid, TreeView) can be enhanced with interactive elements like buttons and toolbars
- Dialog and Window components work with their respective ActionsBar components for complete functionality

### Accessibility Considerations
- All components are built with accessibility in mind using Kendo React UI's built-in accessibility features
- Use semantic HTML structures provided by the components
- Leverage built-in ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
- Form controls include proper labeling and validation support

### Responsive Design
- Layout components provide responsive behavior out of the box
- GridLayout and TileLayout components adapt to different screen sizes
- Mobile-friendly navigation patterns are built into BottomNavigation and responsive AppBar
- Components support Kendo React UI's responsive design system

### Performance Considerations
- Grid component supports virtualization for large datasets
- Animation components are optimized for smooth performance
- Components support lazy loading and on-demand rendering where applicable

### Theming Support
- All components support Kendo React UI's theming system
- Components can be styled using CSS variables and theme customization
- The default Kendo theme is included in the project dependencies
